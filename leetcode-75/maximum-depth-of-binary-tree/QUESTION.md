# [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree][question-link]

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1:
![img.png](assets/images/example-1.png)
```text
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:
```text
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
