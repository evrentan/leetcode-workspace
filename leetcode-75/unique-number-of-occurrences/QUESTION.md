# [1207. Unique Number of Occurrences][question-link]

Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

### Example 1:
```text
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

### Example 2:
```text
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
```

### Example 3:
```text
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
* -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000
